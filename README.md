# The Gilded Goat
The Gilded Goat is a personal project designed to house resources to streamline D&D games for both GMs and Players. Because D&D experiences can be very different between the two, resources are split along those lines. This is an ongoing project with new features added as time permits and new problems to solve come up.

You can take a look at the live version of this project, here: https://thegildedgoat.netlify.app/

# For GMs:
Many of the resources built for GMs include random generators - keeping games moving quickly by letting you grab a random item when your player rolls a high investigation, snag a new monster to help flesh out your dungeon, or create yet another NPC when the party decides to RP with everyone in this random shop you made up on the spot.

Currently, the GM resources are built with HTML, CSS, JS. I've used 2 APIs - https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#overview--getting-started and https://open5e.com/api-docs

Future goals for the GM resources include saving NPC information for when your party inevitably returns to the same random shop again and a tavern/shop name generator.

# For Players: 
In Progress is a character builder that will allow players to house their character builds and generate random characters for quick one-shots. This is being built with HTML, CSS, and JS. 

APIs for this project include: https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/#overview--getting-started and https://open5e.com/api-docs

# SRD-Only Content
Please note: this is a free personal project built for fun that uses content from Wizard's of The Coast's Dungeons and Dragons 5e. As such, all information included on this repository and the published site will only include SRD information, as all else is a part of their Published IP.

# Additions Welcome
If D&D has taught me anything, it's shown me that things are always more fun when we come together as a team. Additions to this repo are welcome. Let's make this project better together. Please keep added content limited to the SRD. Requests that include WOTC IP from their published books will not be included.
